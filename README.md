# Naval Battle
Naval battle, also called touch-and-sink, is a board game in which two players must place “ships” on a secret grid and try to “hit” the opposing ships. 
The winner is the one who manages to sink all of the opponent's ships before all of his own are.

# In this version
Same as the original naval battle game.
